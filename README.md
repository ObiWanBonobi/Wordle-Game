# Introduction

 I'm thrilled to present my very own Python-based Wordle game that promises to challenge and entertain you in equal measure. Dive into the realm of word-guessing, where you'll be tasked with unraveling a hidden five-letter word through strategic deduction and clever guessing. The users final "score" will be shown in the leaderboard option, if the user scores high enough.


## User experience

Wordle is a simple yet engaging word puzzle game that has gained popularity for its straightforward gameplay and addictive nature. That's why I decided to make my own version. The user experience for my Wordle game has been crafted to ensure both enjoyment and ease of play. The game is made for people who want to embark on a captivating journey of word discovery.


## My vision for the game

In envisioning the Wordle game, my goal was to cultivate an engaging and intellectually stimulating experience for players. I designed the game to strike a perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment. The core concept centers around guessing a hidden five-letter word within a limited number of attempts, fostering a sense of accomplishment when the correct word is uncovered. To enhance the game's appeal, I incorporated a diverse and dynamic word bank, keeping players on their toes with an ever-evolving linguistic challenge.

<details>
<summary>After the rules have been read or skipped, you can type in your name and country you're from :</summary>

<br>

![Name input](assets/images/question_name.png)

It will then validate the name input.

![Validating name input](assets/images/validating_name.png)

Then the country can be typed in.

![Country input](assets/images/question_country.png)

It will then validate the name input.

![Validating country input](assets/images/validating_country.png)

It will then show a small welcome message with whatever name and country (in English) you chose.

<br>

![Start of the game](assets/images/start_game.png)

The word you guess has corresponding emojis underneath. Where if a letter is not in the word chosen by the computer, it will show a red cross underneath that letter. If a letter is in the word but in the incorrect spot, it will show a red circle. And finally if a letter is in the word and also in the correct spot, it will show a green check mark underneath.

# Future features

- I want to change the code around so that if you decide to play again. It will copy the last name and country used. So the user would only have to fill out the name and country once. Currently if I don't have it the way it is now, the game would only add the score which would make the spreadsheet out of sync.
- I want to change the emoji's to having the background of the letter in a different colour for better readability and flow.
- I want the add the alphabet. Were the letters background changes to either red or yellow, when the wrong letter or the letter was in the wrong spot gets guesssed.
- I want to add a feature where after finishing the game and seeing the leaderboard, you see the users score highlighted in the leaderboard. And if the the user scores outside the spectrum of the leaderboard, it will still show seperatly underneath.
- I would like to add a feature that tells the user if a word has already been used.

<br>


# Design

I wanted the colours to have an oldschool vibe to it, so it fits the vibe of a terminal game. I added some cute emojis that would fit with the style. And added a green line through all the "seperate" sections in the game

## Libraries

I know I could use a library for my country list and word list however I wanted to show that I know how to also import from my own folders and also import data from a csv file and a txt file. So I import a few different ways

I got my libraries from different websites from the Code Institure project called Love Sandwiches :
- [<b>gspread</b>](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.10.0/) : The Code Institute helped me learn about that gspread is needed for connecting my Google Sheets to my python code.
- [<b>sys</b>](https://codedamn.com/news/python/exit-python-program-from-terminal) : I used the sys.exit() for when the user wants to exit the game.
- [<b>Rich</b>](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#installation) : I used the pannelling for the start page with Rich. Rich is also used to set the console width. And rprint() was used to print colourfull messages.
- [<b>Random</b>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-random-module/) : I used the Random import to randomize the word chosen by the computer.
- [<b>Credentials</b>](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.oauth2.service_account.html) : The Code Institute helped me learn about credentials and that I needed them for my Google Sheets, which is used for my leaderboard list.
- [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) : Was needed for deleting the wordle error message after 2 seconds. 

<br>

# Bug fixes

- When I ran the game after adding a validation for the word input, it kept going to the error that I wasn't using a real word. I started trouble shooting and found that I was comparing the user input with my english list. However my english list was in lowercase and my input I wanted the word to be in uppercase. So I changes the words file so that it returned in uppercase.
- I noticed that using country names that contained a space weren't working. I ended up changing the file to a csv file so that fixed it.
- I noticed that some of the words in the words file were names and also words that noone will know. So I went through the list to delete them.
- The leaderboard wasn't updating properly. I had the code written that you enter you name and country once and then the guesses will update after you finish playing the game. However when you wanted to play again only the leaderboard guesses would update and the rows would become out of sync. I fixed it by changing the code around that you fill in your name and country every time.
- There was an issue with the score adding a point even if the wrong word was used. I had placed the score "+= 1" code in the wrong spot.
- When I deployed my repo for the first time it came up with this error :
    * ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pywin32==306 (from versions: none)
    * ERROR: No matching distribution found for pywin32==306<br>
I googled it online and [this forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50026190/heroku-fails-to-install-pywin32-library) told me to just delete "pywin32==306" from my requirements file.
- My Favicon wasn't working because I forgot to set up the correct path to the file.
- When the user entered their name and country it would update that data in the spreadsheet, however if the user then closes the game or there's an error, the spreadsheet would be out of sync. Because the score was only updating after finishing the game. I added parameters to the get_user_input function and added them to the play_wordle function.
- My y and n questions were closing the program after typing in the wrong input. I had forgotten to make these questions a while loop.
- When the user would type in the country input, every letter combo that is in the countries file would work for country validation. I had forgotten to make the country input a string, to fix this issue.

<b>I have not noticed any existing bugs.</b>
